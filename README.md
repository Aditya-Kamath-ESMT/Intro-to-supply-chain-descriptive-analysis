# Supply Chain Analysis – Descriptive Analytics Project

## Project Overview
This project explores a supply chain dataset to analyze delivery performance, transportation efficiency, supplier reliability, inventory management, and product-level revenue contribution. The analysis focuses on identifying operational patterns and potential improvement areas using descriptive analytics techniques.

## Project Context
This is my **first supply chain analytics project**, completed as part of my learning journey in data analytics.  
The dataset used is a **small, toy dataset** designed for educational purposes, allowing a clear focus on understanding supply chain concepts, key metrics, and analytical reasoning rather than model complexity or scale.

The goal of this project was to **build foundational intuition** around supply chain data, explore common operational questions, and practice translating data insights into business-relevant observations.

## Dataset
The dataset contains simulated supply chain information related to:
- Products and SKUs
- Sales and revenue
- Inventory levels and availability
- Shipping times and shipping costs
- Transportation modes and routes
- Suppliers and locations

The dataset is clean, compact, and well-suited for exploratory and descriptive analysis.

## Objectives
- Analyze delivery performance and shipping time distributions
- Compare transportation modes based on delivery speed
- Examine shipping cost behavior
- Evaluate supplier delivery performance
- Assess inventory alignment with demand
- Understand revenue contribution by product type

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Key Insights
- Delivery times are generally stable, with limited availability of faster delivery options
- Transportation mode significantly affects shipping speed
- Shipping costs vary widely and are not driven by delivery time alone
- Supplier delivery performance differs meaningfully across the network
- Inventory levels are not always aligned with sales volume
- Skincare products generate the highest share of revenue

## Conclusion
Although this analysis is based on a toy dataset, it demonstrates the end-to-end analytical thought process required in supply chain analytics—from data cleaning and exploration to KPI evaluation and insight generation. The project serves as a strong foundation for working with larger, real-world supply chain datasets in the future.

## Future Improvements
- Apply the analysis to real-world or larger datasets
- Introduce supply chain KPIs such as service level or fill rate
- Extend the project with forecasting or optimization techniques
